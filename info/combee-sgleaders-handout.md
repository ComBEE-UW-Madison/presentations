# ComBEE Study Group Leader Expectations and Facilitating Discussions 

## Expectations: 

- Send a reminder email to the appropriate listserv one day prior to meeting
- Fill in head counts for attendance tracking
- Set up an outlet for collaborative notetaking (Google docs, HackMD, etc.)
- Update the study group Github repository with topic information/notes/code
- Attend every meeting or find a replacement in your absence
- Facilitate discussions in an enthusiastic and encouraging environment 

## Facilitating Discussions: 

Leading discussions should not feel like a homework assignment, rather whatever you and others want to get out of it, you put into it. Thus, you can prepare as much or as little ahead of time as you see fit. This can be in the form of concrete lessons such as how [UofT Coders](https://uoftcoders.github.io/studyGroup/lessons/) structure their study groups, creating an informal Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown file such as our previous lesson on [`apply` in R](http://rpubs.com/lizilla93/258391) hosted on RPubs, or walking through a piece of code you or somebody else have written. We also encourge live code-review if a study group member has specific questions about their code concerning that day's topic. Whatever the resource, please update the study group Github repository before meeting, and post a link to that day's notes.

Whether you have prepared material to go through or not, you should still have a general flow for the discussion. I particularly like how UofT Coders structured [this lesson](https://github.com/UofTCoders/studyGroup/blob/gh-pages/lessons/python/pandas2/UofT-pandas.ipynb) on using the pandas package in python. When facilitating a discussion, you should generally hit on the following: 

- Quick introductions if there are a number of new people
- Remind others how to access the website/study group Github repository
- What is the purpose of this package? How can one use it for general datasets? Are there specific uses for biologists? 
- How do you install/import the package? Was it easy to install? 
- Provide links to the original documentation for a certain package, or links to other lessons, blog posts etc. 
- What are the common classes/methods for this package? 
- Provide run-throughs with example datasets or made-up dataframes. Make sure the dataset can be accessed via the web or is deposited in the Github repo/topic notes.   

## Github Site Organization

```
python-study-group-
    | - README.md

    | - Semester folder (example 2017Fall)
    	| + put each individual meeting's file here 
    		| - contains the link to the collaborative document and then a copy of the notes from the collaborative document in here after the meeting
